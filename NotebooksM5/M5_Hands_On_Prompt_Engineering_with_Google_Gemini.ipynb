Here are two, with explanations highlighting their strengths and weaknesses:\n\n**Method 1: Using a subquery**\n\nThis method is generally considered more readable and easier to understand, especially for those less familiar with window functions.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    e.EmployeeName,\n    s.Salary\nFROM\n    employees e\nJOIN\n    salaries s ON e.EmployeeId = s.EmployeeId\nJOIN\n    departments d ON e.DepartmentId = d.DepartmentId\nWHERE\n    d.DepartmentName = 'IT'\nORDER BY\n    s.Salary DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\n* **Explanation:** This query first joins the three tables to bring together employee information, salary, and department.  It then filters for employees in the 'IT' department. Finally, it orders the results by salary in descending order and limits the output to the top row (the highest salary).\n\n* **Strengths:** Clear, easy to understand, works well even with potential ties in salary (it returns one of the employees with the highest salary).\n\n* **Weaknesses:** Can be slightly less efficient than methods using window functions, especially on very large datasets.\n\n\n**Method 2: Using a window function (MySQL 8.0 and later)**\n\nThis method leverages the power of window functions for potentially better performance on large datasets.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    EmployeeName,\n    Salary\nFROM (\n    SELECT\n        e.EmployeeName,\n        s.Salary,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY s.Salary DESC) as rn\n    FROM\n        employees e\n    JOIN\n        salaries s ON e.EmployeeId = s.EmployeeId\n    JOIN\n        departments d ON e.DepartmentId = d.DepartmentId\n    WHERE\n        d.DepartmentName = 'IT'\n) ranked_salaries\nWHERE rn = 1;\n```\n\n* **Explanation:**  This query uses a subquery to assign a rank to each employee within the 'IT' department based on their salary (highest salary gets rank 1). The outer query then selects only the employee with rank 1.  `ROW_NUMBER()` handles ties by assigning unique ranks.\n\n* **Strengths:** Can be more efficient than the subquery approach, especially for large datasets.  Handles ties consistently.\n\n* **Weaknesses:** Requires MySQL 8.0 or later (which supports window functions).  Slightly more complex to understand for those unfamiliar with window functions.\n\n\n**Choosing the best method:**\n\nFor most cases, especially if readability is prioritized or if you're using an older MySQL version, **Method 1 (the subquery approach)** is perfectly adequate.  If you're working with a very large dataset and using MySQL 8.0 or later, **Method 2 (the window function approach)** might offer better performance.  Always test both methods on your specific data to determine which performs best.  Remember to handle potential `NULL` values in the `Salary` column appropriately if they exist in your data, perhaps by adding `WHERE s.Salary IS NOT NULL` to both queries.\n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Task 5: Information Extraction\n","\n","This prompt tests an LLM's capabilities for extracting and analyzing key entities from documents"],"metadata":{"id":"-mck_SlcM3bG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["clinical_note = \"\"\"\n","60-year-old man in NAD with a h/o CAD, DM2, asthma, pharyngitis, SBP,\n","and HTN on altace for 8 years awoke from sleep around 1:00 am this morning\n","with a sore throat and swelling of the tongue.\n","He came immediately to the ED because he was having difficulty swallowing and\n","some trouble breathing due to obstruction caused by the swelling.\n","He did not have any associated SOB, chest pain, itching, or nausea.\n","He has not noticed any rashes.\n","He says that he feels like it is swollen down in his esophagus as well.\n","He does not recall vomiting but says he might have retched a bit.\n","In the ED he was given 25mg benadryl IV, 125 mg solumedrol IV,\n","and pepcid 20 mg IV.\n","Family history of CHF and esophageal cancer (father).\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"UxciK2wsIw3U"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = f\"\"\"\n","Act as an expert in analyzing and understanding clinical doctor notes in healthcare.\n","Extract all symptoms only from the clinical note information below.\n","Differentiate between symptoms that are present vs. absent.\n","Give me the probability (high/ medium/ low) of how sure you are about the result.\n","Add a note on the probabilities and why you think so.\n","\n","Output as a markdown table with the following columns,\n","all symptoms should be expanded and no acronyms unless you don't know:\n","\n","Symptoms | Present/Denies | Probability.\n","\n","Also expand all acronyms.\n","Output that also as a separate appendix table in Markdown.\n","\n","Clinical Note:\n","```{clinical_note}```\n","\"\"\"\n","response = get_completion(prompt, model='gemini-1.5-flash')"],"metadata":{"id":"GcazKzm0JGKc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(Markdown(response))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":899},"id":"pqXCxmtEJl4h","outputId":"7a4eac75-f860-4d76-9507-237482430279"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"| Symptoms | Present/Denies | Probability |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sore throat | Present | High |\n| Tongue swelling | Present | High |\n| Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) | Present | High |\n| Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) due to upper airway obstruction | Present | High |\n| Shortness of breath (SOB) | Denies | High |\n| Chest pain | Denies | High |\n| Itching | Denies | High |\n| Nausea | Denies | High |\n| Rash | Denies | High |\n| Esophageal swelling | Present | Medium |\n| Vomiting | Denies/Uncertain | Medium |\n| Retching | Present | Medium |\n\n\n**Probability Note:**\n\nThe probabilities are assigned based on the explicit statements within the clinical note.

For example, you might chain together an LLM for summarization, another for question answering, and a database lookup.\n* **Indexes:**  Connect LLMs to your own data (documents, databases, etc.) so they can access and process information relevant to your specific needs.  This allows for more informed and accurate responses.\n* **Agents:**  Allow LLMs to decide which tools (like LLMs, databases, calculators, etc.) to use to answer a question or complete a task.  This enables more autonomous and flexible applications.\n\nIn essence, LangChain provides a structured and modular way to build more sophisticated and powerful applications that leverage the strengths of LLMs while mitigating their limitations.
