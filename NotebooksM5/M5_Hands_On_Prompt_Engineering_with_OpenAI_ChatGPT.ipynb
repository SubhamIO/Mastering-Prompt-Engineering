The Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting pattern is a technique used to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models by encouraging them to think step-by-step through a problem. Below is an example of how to implement a Chain of Thought prompt using the OpenAI Python library.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the OpenAI library installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install openai\n```\n\nNext, you can use the following Python code to create a Chain of Thought prompt pattern:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\n# Set your OpenAI API key\nopenai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'\n\ndef generate_chain_of_thought_prompt(question):\n    # Create a Chain of Thought prompt\n    prompt = (\n        \"Let's think step by step. \"\n        f\"Question: {question}\\n\"\n        \"Step 1: Analyze the question and break it down into smaller parts.\\n\"\n        \"Step 2: Consider each part carefully and reason through it.\\n\"\n        \"Step 3: Combine the insights from each part to arrive at a final answer.\\n\"\n        \"Final Answer: \"\n    )\n    return prompt\n\ndef get_answer(question):\n    # Generate the Chain of Thought prompt\n    prompt = generate_chain_of_thought_prompt(question)\n\n    # Call the OpenAI API\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # or \"gpt-4\" if you have access\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n        ],\n        max_tokens=150,  # Adjust based on your needs\n        temperature=0.0,  # Lower temperature for more deterministic output\n    )\n\n    # Extract and return the answer\n    answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']\n    return answer\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    question = \"What is the capital of France?\"\n    answer = get_answer(question)\n    print(\"Answer:\", answer)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **API Key**: Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n2. **Prompt Generation**: The `generate_chain_of_thought_prompt` function creates a structured prompt that encourages the model to think step-by-step.\n3. **API Call**: The `get_answer` function sends the prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves the model's response.\n4. **Example Usage**: The script includes an example question about the capital of France, but you can replace it with any question you want.\n\n### Note:\n- Adjust the `max_tokens` parameter based on how long you expect the answer to be.\n- The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the output; a value of `0.0` makes the output more deterministic.\n\nThis code should help you implement a Chain of Thought prompting pattern using the OpenAI Python library effectively!"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Task 4: Coding Tasks - SQL\n","\n","This prompt tests an LLM's capabilities for generating SQL code based on various tasks"],"metadata":{"id":"0JoSF5wb_Imw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = f\"\"\"\n","Act as an expert in generating SQL code.\n","\n","Understand the following schema of the database tables carefully:\n","Table departments, columns = [DepartmentId, DepartmentName]\n","Table employees, columns = [EmployeeId, EmployeeName, DepartmentId]\n","Table salaries, columns = [EmployeeId, Salary]\n","\n","Create a MySQL query for the employee with max salary in the 'IT' Department.\n","\"\"\"\n","response = get_completion(prompt, model='gpt-4o-mini')"],"metadata":{"id":"4XKGZIG3_Tjl"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(Markdown(response))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":398},"id":"4cFqsBtSA7Wx","outputId":"2edb3320-4771-4c58-cbb1-23989b6dd802"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"To retrieve the employee with the maximum salary in the 'IT' department, you can use a SQL query that joins the `departments`, `employees`, and `salaries` tables.
